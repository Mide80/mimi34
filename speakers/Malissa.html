<br>
I rushed inside the hospital crazily, pushing anyone that comes my way, I pushed them roughy as tears
 streamed down my face. <br>

“How’s he??what’s happening to him??” <br>

“Honey, pls stay strong for us… our baby needs to see your face” <br>

I muttered those words as I ran crazily, I was about to enter the emergency room when a doctor 
stepped out dressed in a surgery outfit, he looked tired and stressed out. I gripped his top as 
heavy tears roll down my cheek. <br>

“Where is my husband?” I asked. <br>

“Lana, you have to task it easy”  He said. <br>

“Don’t tell me to take it easy… Lucas, where’s my husband, call him out for me” I whimpered 
loudly and the nurse around glanced at us. <br>

“Lana, he is fine… consider your baby” He said. <br>

“Lucas, I know it’s not fine, don’t lie to me” I whimpered. <br>

“I tried my best and I’m sorry we lost him” He said. <br>

I screamed and it was as if the world was coming to an end, I slowly released his grip 
from his fabric and rushed inside the emergency room pushing the nurses that came my way, 
I pushed them aside roughly. I slowly traced my steps when I saw my husband Eddy covered with a
 white long fabric. <br>

I rushed to his side and removed the fabric away, I whimpered loudly when I saw his face, his eyes are shut. <br>

“No,no,no!!! This is not happening” I shouted. <br>

I pulled his lifeless body close to myself as I wailed loudly. <br>

“Eddy, you can’t leave me alone! I’m carrying our child please” <br>

“You promised to stay with me” <br>

I wailed loudly and lost consciousness, the nurses around rushed to me but I already shut my eyes before
 they could reach my side. <br>
<br>
Fifteen Years Later*** <br>
<br>

I climbed the stairs holding my Dior bag and saw Malissa, my daughter, the baby I detest so much,
 I treat her badly and harshly. I disliked her existence and regretted her existence. <br>

“I should have gotten rid of her the very day I lost my husband, she is nothing but an ill luck” <br>

I got downstairs and wear a stern look, Malissa sighted me and smiled but I ignored her smile, she 
greeted me and I also ignored her greetings. <br>

“Watching cartoons at this hour??” I said. <br>

“Mom, it’s…” <br>

“Just shut up!!! Don’t ever call me that name and leave, I don’t want to see your ugly face… 
don’t ruin my beautiful day, just ruin it and I will starve you and throw you inside the dark room”
 I interrupted her. <br>

A liquid dropped down on her face but I didn't care, she ran upstairs without saying anything. Mrs Zoey,
 the eldest maid, followed her immediately. I scoffed and went out of the Mansion, when I got outside I
  saw the driver Mr Nelson standing next to the car door, he sighted me and opened the backseat door. <br>

“Good morning, ma’am” He greeted. <br>

“Morning” I replied and hopped into the car. <br>

I entered the car, he ignite the engine  and drove off. <br>

I got myself occupied with my phone as I searched for the latest business idea. The ride to the office was 
pretty short as the driver broke the silence that was  in the car. <br>

“Ma’am, we are here” He said. <br>

I nodded and he opened the car door, I hopped out and entered the building. <br>

As soon I entered the company the guards and workers greeted me respectfully and I ignored them as 
I was not in the mood to reply to their greetings. <br>

I entered my office and saw Mr Cole seated on the chair comfortably. Mr Cole is my husband’s friend,
 a persistent man. <br>

“What do you want?” I asked. <br>

“Lana, I…” <br>

“Mrs Lana and not Lana” I interrupted. <br>

He smiled but I glared at him feeling disgusted by his existence. <br>

“I brought you a necklace” He said, showing me the necklace. <br>

I took a glimpse of it and walked towards the table without replying to him. <br>

“Lana” He called but I ignored him. <br>

He held my hand, I frowned and yanked my hand away. <br>

“Cole, can you please leave as you can see I am busy” I said. <br>

“It’s okay, just don’t shout…I’m leaving” He said as he stood up. <br>

He left and I took the landline, I dialed my secretary’s number and he picked the call. <br>

“I need you in my office” I said. <br>

I hung up and sat on the chair, I turned on the system as I started operating it. <br>

No sooner I heard a knocked on the door. <br>

“Come in” <br>

My secretary enters the office. <br>

“Ma’am, you called for me” He said, having his eyes glued to the floor. <br>

“How many times have I told you not to allow that Idiot to enter my office again?” I said,
 not taking my eyes off the system. <br>

“I’m sorry” He said and I scoffed. <br>

“If he steps into my office again, I promised to get you fired” I said and he nodded slowly. <br>

“Just get out”  I said. <br>

He left. <br>

<br>
 <br>
Malissa Pov… <br>
<br>

I was sitting in the class alone, reading when Joanna and Catherine entered, they glanced at me and
 walked towards me. I know they are here to insult me again. <br>

“She is so ugly” Joanna said. <br>

“Yeah, her mother doesn’t like… I think she regretted giving birth to her” Catherine said. <br>

My tears are at the verge of falling, I don’t want them to see me in tears so I ran out. I was running 
to the school garden when I bumped into someone. I apologised and ran away without taking a glance at
 the person. I got to the garden and sat down on the bench then I burst into tears. <br>

“Why doesn't mom like me? Why did she hate me so much? Why??” I shouted and burst into more tears. <br>

I was still sobbing when I heard someone’s voice, I raised my head up to know who it was, the person was 
Raymond, my best friend. <br>

“Lisa” He called as she walked towards me. <br>

I wiped my tears away before he could see it, he raised my head up, I faked a smile at him and she
 raised her eyebrows. <br>

“Lisa, what happened to you? Don’t you dare lie to me” He said, staring at me. <br>

“Nothing, Ray” I said and looked away. <br>

He frowned because he  knew I was lying, he turned his back at me and was about to love when I held his hand.
 I narrated everything that happened to him. <br>

“What? Haven’t I warned them to stay away from you? How could they say that to you? I will teach them lessons”
 He said, angrily. <br>

“No, leave them… please” I pleaded. <br>

He nodded and hugged me tightly. <br>

“Can we go to the class now?” He asked, gazing at me. <br>

“Yes” I said and nodded slowly. <br>

We left. <br>

I’m Malissa Wright, the only daughter of Lana Wright, I am fourteen years old, my mom is a businesswoman, 
she worked day and night without giving herself some time to rest. She detest me so much, she doesn’t want
 to see me, I don’t know the reason why she hates me so much but Mrs Zoey told me it was because she gave 
 birth to me the dad dad died but why? Am i at fault? Despite the fact she hates me, I still love her. <br>

“Lisa, it’s okay” Raymond said. <br>

I nodded as we entered the class, immediately Joanna and Catherine saw me, they smirked. Raymond glared at
 them, they hissed angrily and then continued what they were doing. <br>

A few minutes later, the teacher entered the class and started teaching. After she was done with the 
explanation and writing on the white board, she asked us questions. Joanna and her friends were the 
only people that didn’t get the questions right. <br>

“Joanna and Catherine, you guys should see in my office” The teacher said as she walked out of the class. <br>

Joanna and Catherine glanced at me and I smiled at them, I took my backpack and walked out of the class <br>
<br>
Lana Pov… <br>
<br>
It’s getting late and I have to hurry up to make it home, I am exhausted already but I need to
 finish this work before leaving. I was typing some documents on the system when my phone rang. 
 I glanced at it and saw Mr Noel, Lisa’s driver name shown on the story. I exhaled and picked up. <br>

“Hello, Mr Noel” I said as I placed the phone on my ear. <br>

“Good afternoon, Ma’am” He greeted. <br>

“Afternoon, what is it? Why did you call?” I asked. <br>

“Ma’am, I won't be able to pick Malissa in school today because someone just called me now and told me that 
my wife has given birth” He said. <br>

“Ohh, okay… I will pick her up” I said. <br>

“Thank you ma'am” He said. <br>

“Okay” I said and hung up. <br>

I dropped the phone on the table. <br>

“Oh shit, I don’t like to pick the girl at school cause I don’t want to see her ugly face but right now
 I have no choice but to go and pick her at school today. I must finish this work before leaving. <br>

Two hours later, I rushed everything and managed to finish on time, I checked what the time was, I was shocked
 when I saw the time. <br>

“5:30pm” I said as I stood up gently. <br>

I carried my bag and walked majestically out, when I got into the car, I told Mr Nelson to take me to  
Malissa’s school, he nodded and drove off. <br>

A few moments later, we got to her school but we didn’t see her. I was about to look for her when the security 
guard told me that she had already gone home. <br>

“Thanks” I said and entered the car. <br>

“Where to ma’am?” Mr Nelson asked. <br>

“Let’s go home” I said and he drove off. <br>

Malissa Pov… <br>

I got inside, dropped my bag on the couch looking so tired.Hot tears streamed down my face. <br>

"Why didn't Mr Noel come to pick me up? Did mom asked him not to pick me up?" i thought <br>

immediately i saw Mrs Zoey, i wiped my tears away and faked a smile. <br>

“Lisa, ypu don't look happy... what’s wrong?” She asked, walking towards me. <br>

"Nothing" I said, staring at the floor. <br>

"No, Lisa" She said and shook her head. <br>

“Mr Noel didn’t come to pick me up today so I trekked home” I said. <br>

“What?” She exclaimed. <br>

She  was shocked when I was done talking. <br>

“You trekked home, why didn’t Mr Noel come to pick you?” She asked, gazing at me. <br>

“I don’t know, ma’am” i said in a whispered. <br>

“I’m coming, let me make  you a coffee” She said as she stood up. <br>

She was about to leave  when Mom entered, She turned back and greeted her. i don't bother to greet 
her or ask her anything. <br>

“Evening, Mrs Zoey” Mom responded. <br>

She took a glanced at me and went upstairs without saying anything. <br>

“How can a mother do this to her child?” I thought. <br>

Mrs Zoey entered the kitchen to make the coffee. <br>

Some few minutes later, she stepped out of the kitchen, she dropped the coffee on the table <br>

“Thanks, Mrs Zoey” i said and  sipped the coffee. <br>

“You’re welcome, when you are done drinking the coffee, go to your room and take a rest” She said and i nodded. <br>

She stared at me as i  drank the coffee when i  was done, i  took my bag pack and climbed the stairs up. <br>

“Mrs Zoey, can I sleep with you tonight” i asked, climbing the stairs up. <br>

“Yes” She  said with a nod. <br>

I smiled and ran upstairs. <br>
