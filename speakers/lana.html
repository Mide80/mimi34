        Malissa’s Pov <br>
        <br>
At night, I was staring at the sky. I was immersed deeply in my thoughts when Mrs Zoey entered. She tapped 
me, hitting me out of my thoughts. <br>

“Lady, what are you thinking?” She asked, gazing at me. <br>

“Nothing, ma’am” I said and shook my head. <br>

“You are lying, Lisa… I know you very well, tell me what happened?” She asked. <br>

I sighed out loud. <br>

“How would mom do that to me? Why did she hate me so much”  I said, sadly. <br>
“It’s okay, Malissa…. I know as time goes on she would change” She said and I nodded slowly. <br>

I climbed onto the bed and she lay down next to me. <br>

“I wish mom could change her behaviour towards me” I said. <br>

She smiled and I hugged her tightly, she rubbed my hair. I smiled, I wish she could stay with me forever.
Not long, she dozed off and I stared at her for a while. I forced myself  to sleep but I couldn’t sleep so
 I got down on the bed and left the room. <br>

I went to the living room, when I got to the living room, I met mom staring at a picture. I think it is dad’s
 picture, I hid at the back of the couch and stared at her. She hugged the picture tightly, tears slipped down
  her face. <br>

“She loves dad so much but she hates me, what have I done wrong to her, she doesn’t want to see me at all” 
I said, sadly. <br>

I couldn’t hold the tears again so I just had to let it fall, I raised my head up a little but I didn’t see 
mom, I was about to climb the stairs up when I saw her standing in front of me. <br>

“M…om….mom” I stuttered. <br>

“Why are you stuttering?” She said, furiously. <br>

“I’m sorry, mo…”  <br>

“Didn’t I tell you to stop calling me that name” She said, glaring dangerously at me. <br>

I bowed my head on the floor as the heavy tears streamed down my face. <br>

“Why are you here?” She  asked with a frown. <br>

“I couldn’t sleep so I came here to watch a movie” I said, having my eyes glued to the floor. <br>

“When you can’t sleep, can’t you take your book to study rather than watching a movie?” She said, angrily. <br>

“I’m sorry, mo…ma’am” I said, in tears. <br>

I was about to leave when she asked me to stop. <br>

“Didn’t I tell you not to show me your ugly face again” She said but I didn’t say anything. <br>

“Lisa, you are daring me… I think you wanna stay in your room for the whole week” She said and glared at me. <br>

She pushed me away and left, I fell landing my butt on the floor. <br>

“How could a mother do this to her own child?” I said as I wiped the tears away. <br>

I was climbing the stairs when I saw Mrs Zoey standing on the stairs. <br>

“Mrs Zoey” I called and hugged her tightly. <br>

“It’s okay, Lisa” She said and patted my back. <br>

“No, it’s not okay… the more she sees me, the more she hates me” I said, sadly. <br>

She sighed and assured me everything is gonna be fine, I nodded slowly then we went to the room together. <br>
<br>
The Next Day*** <br>
<br>

Mrs Lana Pov… <br>
<br>

I groaned as the alarm rang, I traced my hand to the place the alarm was and switched it off and I got 
down on the bed. I checked the time as I undressed my clothes, after getting undressed, I went into the
 washroom. Some  minutes later, I stepped out of the washroom with a towel wrapped on my body, I got dressed 
 when I was done, I glanced at myself in the mirror then I left the room. <br>

I climbed the stairs gently when I got to the sitting room, I met the room already serving the dishes, as soon
 as they saw me, they greeted me and I responded to their greetings. I walked to the dining room.  <br>

I was eating when Malissa ran down, she greeted me as she sat down. I frowned and glared at her and she sighed. <br>
<br>
Few Minutes later… <br>
I was done eating, I collected the hand towel from the rail, after cleaning my hand thoroughly, I dropped 
the apron and took my bag, I left the room. I got outside then I met Mr Newton standing beside the car, as
 soon as he saw me, he greeted me and collected my beg. He dropped them in the car and opened the car door
  for me, I entered the car and he drove off. The drive to the company was so silent. <br>

Hours later… <br>
<br>

We got to the company, he opened the car door and I stepped out of the car gently, I walked into the company,
 the guards and workers greeted me respectfully then I responded to their greetings. I was walking into my 
 office when Collins called me, I stopped walking and faced him. <br>

“Ma’am, Mr Joel came to the company this morning” He said, having his eyes glued to the floor. <br>

“What does he want?”  <br>

“He said I should give you some files” He said. <br>

“Okay, bring the files to my office” I said and walked away. <br>

When I got to my office, I dropped my bag on the table. I was about to sit down when I saw an envelope 
on the table. I took it and saw a letter inside. After reading the letter, I trashed it. I hissed and sat
 down on the chair. <br>

Sooner later, I heard a knock on the door. <br>

“Who is that?” I asked as I switched on the system. <br>

“Ma’am, it’s me” <br>

I heard a familiar voice, I knew it was Collins so I asked to come in. <br>

“This is the files Mr Joel brought, ma’am” He said and I collected the files. <br>

“You may leave” I said and he left. <br>

I glanced through the files. <br>

“Joel wants to work with our company” I thought. <br>

I was busy operating the system when my phone rang, I saw Cole's name shown on the screen, I smirked and
 hung up. He called again but I didn’t pick up, the phone kept on ringing. I was about to pick the call when
  I heard a knock on the door. <br>

“Come in” I said and a person stepped in. <br>

It was my best friend Kareena. <br>

“Rina” I called with a smile. <br>

“I have missed you so much, darling” She said as we hugged each other. <br>

“I also missed you too” I said and sat down back. <br>

I asked to have a sit. <br>

“Thanks… how have you been?” She asked, gazing at me. <br>

“Fine, why don’t you tell me you would be coming here” I said. <br>

“Sorry, bestie… how is Malissa?” She asked and frowned. <br>

“You know I hate hearing the girl’s name” I said and she rolled. <br>

“Lana, I thought you have changed your attitude towards the girl… she is not the one that killed your…”  <br>

“Just shut up!! If she was not the one that killed my husband…Why did I give birth to her the day I lost your 
husband” I said, angrily. <br>

“I know you won’t listen” She said and checked the time. <br>

I rolled my pretty eyeball. <br>

“Lana, change your attitude towards her” She said. <br>

“Kareena, if you don’t have anything to say except this… leave my office” I said. <br>

“Are you sending me out of your office?” She asked and I nodded. <br>

“I’m already leaving, change your behaviour” She said as she walked out. <br>

Immediately she left, I burst into tears. <br>

“Eddy, I missed you so much” I said as the hot tears streamed down my face. <br>
