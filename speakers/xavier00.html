As soon as I was done with the meeting with the workers, I left the office. When I got outside, I entered the 
car and Mr Newton drove off. Mr Newton was driving speedily when a little boy rushed in front of the car,
 he immediately stepped on the brake to stop the car from hitting the little boy. <br>

He stepped out of the car angrily. <br>

“Can’t you watch where you are going” He said in anger. <br>

The boy burst into tears, I glanced at the little  abs I called Mr Newton then told him to get back in the car.
 He got back inside angrily and continued driving. <br>

“You are the one that caused it, didn’t I tell you to drive slowly” I said with a frown. <br>

He was silent for a while. <br>

“I’m sorry, ma’am” He apologised and I nodded. <br>
<br>
Hours Later… <br>
<br>
We got to the Mansion and I entered the living room and couldn’t find Malissa, I glanced around. I’m so happy, 
she didn’t show her ugly face today, I don’t wanna see her. I was climbing the stairs when Mrs Zoey showed up,
 she greeted me and I responded. <br>

“Ma’am, Malissa is not back from school” She said, gazing at me. <br>

“Why are you telling me? You should have called MrNelson and asked him the reason why he hadn't gone and 
picked her” I said. <br>

“I have call… <br>

“Mrs Zoey, I’m so tired right… Malissa is no longer a baby, she will come home” I said as I
 climbed the stairs. <br>

When I got to my room, I dropped my bag and sat down on the bed. I stared at the mirror. I sighed out loud 
then I got undressed. I wrapped a towel on my body and was about to enter the washroom when my phone rang.
 I checked the caller and it turned out to be Mr Cole. I hissed and picked up. <br>

“Hello” I said, and smirked. <br>

“Lana, I know you would pick the call” He said. <br>

I frowned. <br>

“How have you been? I miss you so much” He said. <br>

“Cole,I have told you several  times not to call me Lana, I am Mrs. Lana and not Lana…if you don’t have 
anything to say I will hang up now” I said, furiously. <br>

“I’m sorry, sweetie….” <br>

I hung up before he could finish his statement, I hissed and dropped the phone on the table then entered 
the washroom. After taking a shower, I dressed up and went to the living room. <br>
<br>
Some Minutes Later… <br>
<br>
I was watching a movie when Malissa walked, she glanced at me, she greeted me having her eyes glued to the 
floor. I frowned and hissed. <br>

“Why are you just coming home?” I asked with a frown. <br>

She couldn’t say anything, I got angry and was about to hit her when Mrs Zoey ran out of the kitchen, stopping
 me from hitting her. She stood in front of her. <br>

“Please ma’am, don’t hit her… let her explain” Mrs Zoey pleaded. <br>

“Okay, I’m listening” I said, folding my hands beneath my breast. <br>

“I was….was…I…I” <br>

“Why are you stuttering? If you can’t talk, I will call Mr Nelson outside” Mrs Zoey said as she turned to 
leave. <br>

“He didn’t come to pick me” She said and Mrs Zoey turned back. <br>

“What? You trekked home today too” Mrs Zoey asked. <br>

She nodded then I rolled. <br>

“If you trekked that doesn’t mean you should get to the Mansion by this time” I said, glaring at her. <br>

She raised her head. <br>

“Why are you so wicked? Can’t you even care for me once” She mumbled as she walked away. <br>

“Did she just walk away” I said and was about to follow her when Mrs Zoey stopped me. <br>

“Ma’am, please forgive her” Mrs Zoey pleaded. <br>

I nodded and sat down back on the couch. <br>
<br>
Xavier Pov… <br>
<br>
I got home late at night, and I met mom at the dining table. I walked towards where she was sitting and
 hugged her tightly. She was surprised, I glanced at her. <br>

“What is it?” She asked, gazing at me. <br>

I told her about the new job I got, and she was so happy. <br>

“I’m so happy for you sweetie” She said with a smile. <br>

“Thanks, mom” I said as I checked the time. <br>

“You’re welcome, I prepared you something to eat” She said with a smile. <br>

“I won't be able to eat now, I am going to the club… I already told my friends, I will come to the club to
 celebrate the new job I got” I said and she sighed. <br>

“Mom, when I am back… I promised to eat the food” I said as I climbed the stairs up. <br>

She nodded. <br>
<br>
Few Moments Later… <br>
<br>
I climbed the stairs, I hugged mom before leaving the house. <br>

“Bye, mom” I said and waved at her. <br>

“Bye” She replied and left. <br>

Soon, I got to the club and met my friends already having fun, I smiled and walked towards them. <br>

“Hi, guys” I said with a smile. <br>

“Xavier, you’re here… we thought you aren’t coming today again” Robert and Arthur both said. <br>

“Why won’t I come to celebrate my new job” I said as I sat down next to Arthur. <br>

I collected the drink he was drinking and gulped it. <br>

“Can’t wait to fu**k some bi**h right” Robert asked and winked at me. <br>

I frowned and glared at me. <br>

“You know I don’t do that… those girls are not my taste” I said, pointing at the girls that were dancing on
 the stage. <br>

Arthur smirked. <br>

“We know they aren't your taste? They are b**h, can you one night stand with them” Robert said and I glared at
 him. <br>

“Robert, leave him… let’s go and fu**k some b**ch” Arthur said. <br>

“Are you guys gonna leave me here” I asked but they ignored me and left. <br>

I sighed and brought my phone, I checked the time then gasped. <br>

“Ohh, it’s late… I need to go back home now” I said while standing up. <br>

I glanced at my friends and left. <br>
